# Clean-Dirty-Road
# Road Classification with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This repository contains code and guidelines for a machine learning project that aims to classify roads into clean or littered based on images. The project consists of several tasks, including data preprocessing, model implementation, and performance analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Explanation of the problem and advantages of solving it without machine learning.

**Image Acquisition and Enhancement**:
  - Code and results for image preprocessing and enhancement using R programming.

**Image Data Modeling**:
  - Implementation of machine learning algorithms for image classification.
  - Splitting data into training and testing datasets and analysis of data percentages used.

**Performance Analysis**:
  - Application of evaluation techniques to assess model performance.
  - Proposals to improve classification performance.
